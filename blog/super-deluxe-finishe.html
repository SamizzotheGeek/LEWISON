                <p>Decorating a home can present countless challenges especially to first-timers home owners with little or no information on the latest home decor trends and ideas in Kenya. I visited the resent home décor expo and here some of few things to help you out, I have prepared a quick guide on how to design your bedroom, living room, Kitchen, Dining room, TV room, bathroom and every other room in your home.</p>
<p>1.) Super deluxe theme One of the hottest home decor trends in Kenya today is the classic theme. What is old in the 1970`s or 1980`s will give your home the much-needed face-lift this year. Out of date tables, chairs and fabrics are now finding their way into the trendiest home décor stores in the country. You need to get out there and explore items best suits your house.</p>
<p>2.) Artistic lighting Lighting is quickly becoming a major component of home decoration, with lighting companies introducing bespoke architectural lighting systems into the market. Hanging lights in kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms are being used by many home-owners in Kenya to get a more contemporary look for their homes. In addition, some home-owners are using metallic paint on ceilings to further improve their homes.</p>
<p>3.) Wall murals/ wall papers and coverings Another popular home decor idea in Kenya is the use of wall papers and coverings instead of paint to enhance the look of a room while increasing its comfort. Wall papers can easily be moved from one house to another – making them very attractive to tenants who often change houses. Thanks to the recent environmental conservation awareness campaigns, many home-owners are now seeking decoration accessories made of eco-friendly materials. As such, there is a substantial increase in the number of stores offering items made of biodegradable materials – from wall hangings to carpets.</p>
<p>4.) Colors In terms of colors, playful colors such as orange, brown and red are being used for outdoor furniture and décor while neutral colors are being used for interior décor to give homes a more sophisticated look.</p>
<p>5.) Open floor plan The use of open floor plans is also gaining currency among home-owners in many parts of the world as it gives rooms – especially kitchens – an elegant look. Such one idea I like most, is the open plan of kitchen, dining room all the way to the lounge. Do you have other inspiring home decor ideas in Kenya that we can add on to this list?
