      <h1 id="heading">Building or Buying Ready for Sale House | Which is Better?</h1>
        <div class="blog jumbotron">
                <img src="..\img\Build_or_buy.png" alt="Build or buy">
            <p>This caught me thinking why we have very many real estate developers, who build houses for sale. Do you know why, the market is booming.<br />
                <b>But not for long.</b></p>
                <p>If I may ask what would you prefer buying or building your house?</p>
                <p>Definitely many will say it’s better to buy a ready-for-sale house. Yes, it’s hustle free, through good agents you can have multiple options of different houses in different areas. The process might take you few days and there you are a home owner.</p>
                <p>Buying a house make you a critical shopper comparing different houses, until you land on what you really what.</p>
                <p>As per my advice, i think you should build your own house. Yes, it’s hectic compared with buying a ready-for-sale House but building comes with advantages.</p>
                <p>Building offers you a chance to customize what you want, you can decide on the size, number of rooms, interior and exterior finishes, landscaping and how you may want it.</p>
                <p>Thus you will learn many useful things about house construction, by monitoring the building process. You also have a total control of materials to be used on the project which are environmental friendly, cost-effective and so forth.</p>
                <p>We have number of reports over houses which has started to crack, or peeling off the paints due to substandard materials. Don’t forget the developer is there for the sake of making money/profits.</p>
                <p>Others have reported collapsing after few years. A have a friend of mine who even after my advice of building his own house went ahead and bought one at Syokimau. He bought the house when it was relatively dry, and everything looked sober. Not until when rains came. The developer sold to the client what he wanted, which is the house; but there was no landscaping or drainage controlled. It was shocking when my friend woke up one morning to find his house built under a small lake.</p>
                <p>There was no where he could trace the paths, to the parking, neither towards the gate. He missed his day at work, it took him two weeks to sort out the drainages and landscape: the whole process thus, he went ahead to finance with 1.2M more.</p>
                <p>There more similar cases, houses built on a cotton soil, which developer never bothers to remove causes it could have costed more, which now later develops more serious cases. If you have bought one, check on your agreement, there is no a single day you will ever return to the developer for him to do it from you.</p>
                <p>Such issues can be avoided if you build one. You will be able to get the best area, without cotton soil, areas with less drainages problems and so forth.</p>
                <p>While again, the developers are there to make money, some houses do not meet the cost. Prices are totally hiked and unreasonable, a three bedroom at Kitengela will cost you 4.5M with a standard finishes, which when built inclusive of an eighth plot will cost you an average of 2.5M to 3.2M. A 14M house in Kiambu, to build will cost you 8M to 10M. So your sparing a million to a hustle free for a ready-for-sale houses. Plus, the amount you will need to adjust few things, like paints, kitchen set up, changing their cheap sinks, bath tabs, lighting, even to some they change roofs.</p>
                <p>Final verdict: when all said than done, none of the two options is easier than the other. Both requires hard work, however with right information and right contractors building your own house is cheaper, and you will achieve what your dream has been like. I have seen on this page, people taking even 5 years to build, because there are results that they are up to.</p>
                <p>Nyumba ya kujinjengea, mtu hujivunia.</p>
